The python code is meant for compressing an image size by desired amount. Here it has been reduced and kept to 2%, 9%, 20% and 80%. 
Using fast fourier transform, the image has been converted into frequency domain, then into gray scale. Which is then sorted and certain percentage of the pixels have been kept and the rest has been removed in order to compress it.
